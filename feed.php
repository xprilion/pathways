				<h2>The final moments</h2>
				<p>One would be lying, flat, if they said they didn't want time to stop then and there. Nature's curtain came down on Pathways and slowly (well the park authorities had to force us :p ) we moved towards home...</p>

				<h2>A gift to wear with pride</h2>
				<p>One simply cannot part without a parting gift! While Shashikant sir shook to check whether the long wrapped boxes were Diwali crackers, rockets presumably, we had to contain ourselves from blurting that those gifts would find their way into the wardrobes of the teachers - ties. A hope that we'll be remembered every time they wear it with pride :)</p>

				<h2>Talking about their life in our age</h2>
				<p>After the board exams and before getting into a college, this can count as one of the most confusing and uncertain period of a student's life. What better than to have it from the experienced ones how they went through it? Flashback time for the teachers, a unique lesson to the students.</p>

				<h2>Fun time!</h2>
				<p>And the fun begins!<br><br>We asked our teachers to pick up a topic and to tell their funniest moments associated with it! Here's a summary:<br><br>Piyush Sir: (peaking on Current/Electricity) The only times I've experienced a current is when madam touches me!<br>(Now that's smartly done sir! Indeed!)<br><br>Shuaib Sir (the soon-to-be bridegroom!): (speaking on Exam hall) During the exam, cheating slips passing all over and around, gave me high BP!<br>(behti ganga mein hath dho lete sir!)<br><br>Akhilesh Sir: (speaking on Dogs) Returning  home on bike, the dogs on the way would chase me. Pestered thoroughly, one day I took my car and let them chase me to their heart's fill! <br>(we get the idea! Time to buy a car!)<br><br> Shashi Sir: (speaking on Bunking) We went to school everyday for 2 months without attending class. We would hide and sleep!<br>(inspiration in its purest form! *eyes wet*)</p>
